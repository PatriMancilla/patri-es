# Patri-es, creado con Vue 3 + Vite
This repository wil be used to create my public website as a CV and to practice with vue.js

The projet was created into this folder using ``npm create vite@latest .`` adding a clear vue-vite project inside this folder. 

For now, I'm starting to make it public with Azure options for creating a free static website using my personal domain.
