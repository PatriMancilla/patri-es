# Patri-es, created with Vue 3 + Vite
This repository wil be used to create my public website as a CV and to practice with vue.js

The projet was created into this folder using ``npm create vite@latest .`` adding a clear vue-vite project inside this folder. 

## Publishing the sample version:
For now, I'm starting to make it public with Azure options for creating a free static website using my personal domain. So, I need to run ``npm run build`` that create the **dist folder**. Azure will proccess then my publishing project as configured in the .yaml file.
